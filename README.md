# crop-recomendation-system
crop recommendation system with visualization of all the algorithm with source code
Ai based crop recommendation system is a web based system which is used to recommend the crops for the farmer using machine learning algorithm.
in this project we consider the factors like soil factors and environment factors for recommending the crops for former.
The dataset is used to train the algorithms to give the better results


Dataset
this data set was built by augmenting datasets of rainfall,climate and fertilizer data avaliable
Soil factors: 
Nitrogen content value in soil-N
Phosphorus content value in soil-P
Potassium content value in soil-K
PH value of soil

Environmental factors:
Temperature of area in Celsius
Humidity of area
Rainfall in area in millimetre

technologies used in project
Ml model development:
Scikit-Learn: The sklearn library contains a of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical tools
Pickles: this is a library which is used for conversion on python objects like list, dictionary into byte stream.
Numpy: it is a Python library that provides a data structure: the n-dimensional array.
Pandas: it is used for importing the values from dataset.
Web development :
Flask(Backend)
Html/Css/Js(Frontend)

Algorithm used in project
Decision tree algorithm: it is used to bifurcate the values given by the user and form a tree like structure.
Random Forest : It is a ensemble of decision trees.
Support Vector Clustering(SVC) algorithm: this algorithm is used to cluster the various values present in the decision tree.
K-nearest-neighbour(KNN) algorithm: this is used for finding the nearest value which is provided by the use by comparing it in dataset.
Ensemble Model: A model is created by ensembling together Decision Trees, K-Nearest- Neighbours , Random Forests and Support Vector Machine.
